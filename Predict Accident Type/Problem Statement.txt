Consider National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) provides you a real accidental data set of Bangalore highway of India. The size of data set is (83 x 8). Apply suitable Machine Learning technique to address following problems.
1. Forecast Accident type(variable C in the data set) for year 2015 based on the observations given for year 2014 in the data set. Analyse the predictive results achieved.

[Hint:-

LHS stands for Left-hand sight
RHS stands for Right-hand side
Ch. stands for Chainage which is an imaginary line used to measure distance, often corresponding to the centre of a straight road.
KM/km/KMS is kilometres
ROW - Right of Way - the legal right, established by usage or grant, to pass along a specific route through grounds or property belonging to another, for example, to remove obstructions to make roads
MCW means the main carriageway
Also, 103+123 km means 103 km and 123 metres, or 103.123 metres.
Please note for solving & understanding convenience, either convert "+" values into "." format . Check that the entire column values in the same format ]

2. Use feature Location in the data set to identify the prone area of major accidents.
3. Identify top 5 important features for variable Accident type(variable C in the data set)
